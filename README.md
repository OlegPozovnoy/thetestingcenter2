<h1>The testing center website</h1>

<p>This website is created for users who want to make their own tests in any subject.
It's flexible enough to cover all main tests format and can be used for individual/group exam preparation.</p> 

<p>Bootstrap Readable theme came from <a href="https://bootswatch.com/3/readable/">https://bootswatch.com/3/readable/</a></p> 

<p>The code is deployed at <a href="https://thetestingcenter2.azurewebsites.net/">https://thetestingcenter.azurewebsites.net/</a></p> 

<p>As for "advanced .NET MVC feature that we have not yet learned in class." - I've added "Display" annotation for some fields in order to correct the default names, not sure it may be called "advanced", but the mentioning will not hurt anyway</p>
